# Flow -- Your Best Choice

- This extension is essentially a merge between focus mode and tab grouping extensions, allowing users to divide extensions into groups and activate focus mode within that group. Essentially, all tabs outside of that group become blocked and unavailable to use for a certain amount of time, and only the tabs within the active group will be available to the user, preventing distractions in the process and, as a result, potential increase in productivity.

# Trying to Open New Tabs?

- Different websites, different choices.
- When you open up a new tab, a prompt will give two choices

1.  `Close Tab` - this will close the new tab immediately and thus prevent distraction. Close YouTube now and go back to study!

2.  `Add to Group` - this will allow you to use the website and add it to your group. Please, I need Github to study!
